                         <p>The 2019 fiscal year was a time to celebrate the remarkable history of the Water Authority and a time to cast a new vision for the future.</p><br/>
                          <p>For 75 years, the San Diego County Water Authority has played a pivotal role in our region’s development as an international hub for innovation, recreation, agriculture, trade and so much more. With few natural water resources, strategic supply planning and development is critical to our continued prosperity – which is why it is so important to recognize our collective successes during this 75th anniversary year.</p><br/>
                         <p>First of all, thank you to our 24 member agencies. Your efforts in supply development, water efficiency and recycling, reliable operations, customer service, and other key initiatives are critical to everything else we do. Your collective “can-do spirit” is at the heart of our historic accomplishments. In short, without you there is no Water Authority.</p> <br/>
                         <p>Second to the hundreds of men and women who have served on our Board of Directors over the decades: Your vision and commitment to the public good has made this region a national example of effective collaboration and water supply reliability.</p> <br/>
                         <p>To staff members, both past and present: Without your daily dedication and expertise, San Diego County could not support one of the nation’s largest economies or be the place that we love to call home.</p> <br/>
                         <p>To San Diego County’s civic, business and elected leaders: You have both demanded the best from us and given us critical support to do big things.</p> <br/>
                         <p>Finally, to the region’s water ratepayers: Over the decades, you have invested billions of dollars to ensure safe and reliable supplies – and those investments are the foundation of our future in farming, biotech, defense, tourism and a hundred other industries.</p> <br/>
                         <p>Our history tells us that the road ahead is never easy. We will face difficult decisions about how best to keep San Diego County at the forefront of water supply reliability, and we will face any number of challenges related to new regulations, climate change and other factors that impact how and what we do.</p> <br/>
                         <p>That is why we must never stop thinking about big solutions for our water future – from securing water storage in Lake Mead and assessing the potential for our own canal to deliver Colorado River water to supporting local water purification projects and coordinating regional outreach and education efforts.</p> <br/>
                         <p>By celebrating our shared accomplishments in years gone by, together we will continue to create a better tomorrow for San Diego County.</p>
